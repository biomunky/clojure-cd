# cd-experiment

Code for reading various types of circular dichroism experiment output.  Currently reads gen, jasco, aviv, bp and plain text
(two columns: wavelength, reading).  Can convert data from machine units/yy/mean residue ellipticity to delta epsilon (DE).
DE are used by the PCDDB and should be used by all.  There is also the option to convert any of the formats to a simple
gen-like format, including metadata where present.

## Usage

Copy the .jar to your classpath and then add
(ns your.namespace
	(:use [cd.parser]
		  [cd.experiment]))

cd.parser contains the parsing code
cd.experiment allows for unit conversion and gen creation.

Example:
Parse a file ->

(parse-experiment <full_path_to_file> <type>)
<full_path_to_file> would be: /User/you/mydata/some_experiment.gen
<type>must be one of :gen :plain :jasco :aviv :bp

This returns an Experiment. record containing :meta, :spectrum :wavelength

(def my-exp (parse-experiment "resources/gen.txt" :gen))
(keys my-exp)
[:meta :spectrum :wavelengths] -> it's a plain defrecord at the moment.

Convert to a gen file ->
(def my-aviv (parse-experiment "resources/aviv.txt" :aviv))
(println (print-gen my-aviv))

Gen files often contain raw and processed data.  Files produced by this method will copy your data into
the raw, processed and HT columns (at a later date HTs will be incorporated where available)
